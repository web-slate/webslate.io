## <AnchorLink label="Problem Statement" name />
> Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
1. You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

<CodeBlock>{`
String addStrings(String num1, String num2)
`.trim()}</CodeBlock>

### <AnchorLink label="Constraints" name />
1. 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
1. num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
1. num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

### <AnchorLink label="Expected" name />
1. Sum of Two String return in String

### <AnchorLink label="Test Cases" name />
1. Input = num1 = "11", num2 = "123" Output = "134"
1. Input = num1 = "456", num2 = "77" Output = "533"
1. Input = num1 = "0", num2 = "0" Output = "0"

### <AnchorLink label="Foot Note" name />
***Complexity 1***: Any solution must have time and space complexities of at least O(N) to deal with the array of N integers. A relatively simple solution considering all possible contiguous subarrays, or in fact any solution counting the valid subarrays one-by-one, would require a time complexity of at least O(N^2). However, a number of observations can allow this to be optimized down to the ideal time complexity of O(N). For example, letting L[i] be the number of valid subarrays ending at index i (useful to compute on the way to the final answer), consider how we might efficiently compute L[i] for each i from 1 to N by reusing past information rather than computing it from scratch.  
***Complexity 2***: When analyzing such a solution, note that even if we’re computing N values L[1..N], and computing any single one of those values might take on the order of N steps, the overall time complexity will not necessarily be O(N^2) - we should instead consider how many steps may occur in total across all N of them in the worst case.

### <AnchorLink label="Solution Intro" name />
Lets see the list of approaches and their complexities.
1. Approach 1: Elementary Math
1. Approach 2: Using type casting operators.
1. Approach 3: Computing G[i] for each i from 1 to N is a promising approach, but we’ll still need to consider how to do so as efficiently as possible. We can observe that it’s not possible to compute G[i] purely based on the values of G[i-1], a[i-1], and a[i]; we may need more information about earlier a values as well, but would like to avoid simply scanning over all of them. Out of earlier indices j (such that j < i), we can consider which indices are worth considering as potential candidates for G[i] - for example, if there exists a pair of indices j and k such that j < k and a[j] < a[k], can index j ever be a candidate for G[i] for any i > k? If we can maintain information about the set of these possible candidate indices as we go through the array, it’s possible to efficiently determine the one that’s actually equal to G[i] for each i.

## <AnchorLink label="Solutions" name />
With no further due, lets take a example of code solutions.

### <AnchorLink label="Brute Force" name />
Description

<CodeBlock>{`
var addStrings = function(num1, num2) {
    const n1 = parseInt(num1)
    const n2 = parseInt(num2)
    return (n1+n2).toString();
};

### <AnchorLink label="Approach 1 Using Big Int" name="approach-1-using-big-int" />
Step 1: Convert the both num1 and num2 parameters to Big Integers.<br />
Step 1.1: Add both big integers and store it in `result` variable.<br />
Step 2: Pass it to String constructor and return the value.<br />
Step 2.1: Alternative - Convert the big integer result to string using `toString()`.<br />
Step 2.2: Alternative - Convert to String using template literals.<br />

<CodeBlock>{`
var addStrings = function(num1, num2) {
    const result = BigInt(num1) + BigInt(num2);
    return String(result);
    // return result.toString() // OR
    // return \`$\{result\}\` // OR
};
`.trim()}</CodeBlock>

<BigO type="space" value="n+m" />

### <AnchorLink label="Approach 1 Elementary Math" name />
Step 1: Initialize `result` as empty string and `carry` as zero.<br />
Step 2: Store both numbers length to additional variable as `num1Length`, `num2Length`.<br />
Step 3: Run while until any length variable is greater than or equal to zero.<br />
Step 4: Compute the iterated index value to additional variable as `num1Result`, `num2Result`.<br />
Step 5: IF index is greater than or equal to zero store the index value subtract with `0` zero string else numeric 0 zero.<br />
Step 6: Initialize `value` adding `num1Result` and `num2Result` module by 10<br />
Step 7: Update `carry` adding `num1Result` and `num2Result` divided by 10 with <br />
Step 8: Append the `value` first to `result` variable as suffix.<br />
Step 9: decrement the `num1Length` and `num2Length`.<br />
Step 10: Append the `carry` first and `result` variable as suffix to the same result only if `carry` is not equal to `0`.<br />
Step 11: return computed string.<br />

<CodeBlock>{`
function addStrings(num1, num2) {
    let result = '';
    let carry = 0;
  
    let num1Length = num1.length - 1;
    let num2Length = num2.length - 1;
  
    while (num1Length >= 0 || num2Length >= 0) {
      let x1 = num1Length >= 0 ? num1[num1Length] - '0' : 0;
      let x2 = num2Length >= 0 ? num2[num2Length] - '0' : 0;
      let value = (x1 + x2 + carry) % 10;
      carry = ((x1 + x2 + carry) / 10) | 0;
      result = \`$\{value\}$\{result\}\`
      num1Length--;
      num2Length--;
    }
  
    if (carry != 0) {
      result = \`$\{carry\}$\{result}\`
    }
  
    return result

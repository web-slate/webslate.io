A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.  

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.  

Write a function:  
<CodeBlock>{`
function solution(X, Y, D) {
  // write your code in JavaScript (Node.js 8.9.4)
}
`}</CodeBlock>

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.  

For example, given:

- X = 10
- Y = 85
- D = 30

the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:  

- after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
- after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
- after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:  

- X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
- X â‰¤ Y.

<CodeBlock>{`
function solution(x, y, d) {
    // write your code in JavaScript (Node.js 8.9.4)
    if ((y - x) % d === 0) {
       return (y - x) / d;
    }
    return Math.ceil((y - x) / d);
}
`}</CodeBlock>
